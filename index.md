# MENU ITEM: EXPLORATIVE COMMUNICATION THERAPY
# PAGE TITLE: EXPLORATIVE COMMUNICATION THERAPY THROUGH DIGITAL MEDIA ARTS

## Have you ever thought about becoming a voice actor? 

## Have you ever dreamed about one day seeing your face in video games, cartoons, film and television?

### If so, then you've come to the right place. With COVID-19, content has become king. Therefore, we believe that teaching our communities how to become EXPERT COMMUNICATORS can be both therapeutically and economically uplifting.

Therefore, for a limited time, ConnexMatch will be offering intimate, small group classes with none other than Christian Potenza himself.

Christian Potenza is best known for playing Jude on 6teen (Nickelodeon) and Chris McLean in the Total Drama (Comedy Network) franchise.

#### Topics Included: 
- FIVE FINGERS OF SELF-DIRECTION
- COMMUNICATION TRIANGLE
- CHARACTER CROSS
- TONE DIAMOND
- MONOLOGUE MASTERY
- SLATING
