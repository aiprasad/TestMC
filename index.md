### CURRICULUM OVERVIEW

| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: |

#### THE AUDITION TOTEM POLE & SLATING

The job of an actor is to audition. But what do I do when I arrive? Casting Directors have a secret expectation when you first walk in the door.

Professional Casting Directors *expect* auditioning actors to follow a specific set of instructions when they arrive. Understanding the Audition Totem Pole will ensure that you impress Casting Directors with your range and adaptability.

The Audition Totem Pole & Slating process is very similar to the process followed by Fortune 500 companies when interviewing potential candidates. Understanding the Audition Totem Pole will make the student not only a better actor, but a better interviewer when they start their careers.

#### THE FIVE FINGERS OF SELF-DIRECTION

1. What did I notice about my first attempt at reading this script? 
2. What did I like? 
3. What didnâ€™t I like? 
4. What am I going to change in my second attempt at reading this script?
5. How am I going to change it?

#### COMMUNICATION TRIANGLE

In any communication, there are three factors and two forces at play:

#### Three Factors:

1. You
2. The Other Person
3. The Shared Environment

#### Two Forces: 

1. Guiding Force
2. Driving Force

How might we apply our understanding of The Communication Triangle as we discover our inner voice?

| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: |

#### CHARACTER CROSS

Did you know there are four main archetypes found in our most beloved stories? They are:

1. The Hero
2. The Villain
3. The Sidekick
4. The Mentor

By understanding and applying our understanding of The Character Cross and the four archetypes, we can begin to develop our personal Character Library.

#### TONE DIAMOND

"It's not what you say, it's how you say it." - Anon

The Tone Diamond is intimately connected to The Character Cross. Whereas The Character Cross denotes the type of Character you're playing, the Tone Diamond informs the way you speak.

The Four Directions of the Tone Dimaond are:
- North: fast-paced, high energy, friendly
- South: slow-paced, low-energy, serious, flat/monotone
- East: formal, industrial, broadcast, announcer/host
| - West: casual, laid back, easy-going, relaxed, (right) |
